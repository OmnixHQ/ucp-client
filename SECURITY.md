## Security Practices

This library follows these security practices:

- **No credential echoing** — OAuth error messages never include raw gateway response bodies
- **Buffer.from for Base64** — uses Node-native encoding, not browser `btoa`
- **Input validation at boundaries** — Zod schemas validate all external data
- **Immutable interfaces** — all types use `readonly` to prevent accidental mutation
- **No hardcoded secrets** — credentials flow through parameters, never stored in code
- **URL encoding** — all dynamic path segments use `encodeURIComponent`
